### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Keegan!

On a self-learning journey, exploring paths and seeing what they have to offer

ðŸ“– What I have been working on for the past 3 months:
1. I signed up for 3 courses on the Interaction Design Foundation platform
  * Design Thinking: The Ultimate Guide.
  * User Experience: The Beginner's Guide.
  * Design for the 21st Century with Don Norman.
2. I took up the "Build Your First Web Pages With HTML and CSS" course on https://openclassrooms.com/en/ to build my foundation of these languages.

  ðŸ“‘ The projects I worked on: 
 -  https://github.com/keeganedwin/openclassrooms
 -  https://github.com/keeganedwin/keeganedwin-openclassrooms-2
4. Proceeding this I moved to the https://www.theodinproject.com/ and continued from where I left off - I started the foundation course, passed git basics and setting up github until HTML; personally did not find their content easy to grasp as opposed to OC - and continued until I reached "Alignment".

  ðŸ“‘ The project I worked on: https://github.com/keeganedwin/odin-recipes

5. I have also been learning to use Figma and have only come as far as creating low-fidelity wireframes.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning to:
- Build components on Figma
- Use Flexboxes and Alignments - The Odin Project
